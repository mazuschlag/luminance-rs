//! That module exports blending-related types and functions.
//!
//! Given two pixels *src* and *dst* – source and destination, we associate each pixel a blending
//! factor – respectively, *srcK* and *dstK*. *src* is the pixel being computed, and *dst* is the
//! pixel that is already stored in the framebuffer.
//!
//! The pixels can be blended in several ways. See the documentation of [`Equation`] for further
//! details.
//!
//! The factors are encoded with [`Factor`].
